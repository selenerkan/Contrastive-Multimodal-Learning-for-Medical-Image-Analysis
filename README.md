# Multimodal Self Supervised Network for ADNI

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to combine imaging and non-imaging dataset to make better disease diagnostics.

## 1. Dataset

For initial evaluation of the approach ADNI dataset is used. The dataset can be retrieved from: https://ida.loni.usc.edu/login.jsp?project=ADNI after getting access rights.

There is one image dataset and one tabular dataset. Both dataset consist inputs of the patients. There are 299 different patients with multiple visits. On average one patient has 2-3 visits. After each visit an MRI scan is taken and a new input to the tabular data entered. So, both the tabular and image dataset has more than one input for patients.
